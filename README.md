# flutter_hang_without_async

A small app that shows how the UI hangs when no asynchronity is used.

This application is a practical demonstration of the importance of asynchronicity in Flutter development.
It specifically illustrates how the user interface can become unresponsive or "hang" when asynchronous operations are not properly implemented.

The app is designed to simulate a real-world scenario where data is fetched from an external source, such as a network request.
In the absence of asynchronous operations, the UI waits for the data fetching operation to complete before it can proceed with other tasks.
This results in a hanging or frozen UI, negatively impacting the user experience.

The goal of this project is to highlight the significance of asynchronous operations in creating smooth, responsive applications.
It serves as a learning tool for developers, particularly those new to Flutter, to understand the concept of asynchronicity and its role in building efficient applications.

To get the most out of this project, try running the app before and after implementing asynchronous operations to observe the difference in performance and responsiveness.
